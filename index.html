  <p class="css-typing">Hi! My name's Maureen! Nice to meet you!</p>

  <p> Thank you for taking the time to come to my page. When I read the job listing for the Customer Success Manager, I was really excited that you were asking for a creative project in lieu of a resume. I decided to communicate my personal story through this made-from-scratch web site (there is a link to my source code below), as my journey to learn to code is also tied to why I would be a great candidate for this position.</p>

  <p>But first, I will start from the beginning. I grew up in Jersey City, a city that, despite being located in the Garden State, is not well-known for its farms.  However, on a plot of dirt no larger than 300 square feet, my father tenderly raised tomatoes, bittermelons, and sometimes peppers and eggplants (if the squirrels did not get to them first).  In the summer, the climbing vines of the bittermelons create something akin to magic.  The whole yard is transformed.  As a child I learned the beauty and deliciousness of growing something yourself and eating it.  At the same time, I learned about how uncertainties like weather and garden pests-- too little rain, too much rain, too much heat, not enough heat, frisky squirrels and hungry birds-- can affect one's yield.  My father has perfected his process over the years, so that now he can predictably supply happy local restaurants with his bittermelons (about 300 pounds of produce over one summer!) But I still remember the early years of trial and error that marked my dad's time in his garden, and how perhaps that could have been avoided or reduced if he had the right help.</p>

  <p>Fast forward many years. I am now an adult volunteering with a local organization, Food Not Bombs, which salvages unsold produce and baked goods from local farmers markets and bakeries to distribute to the homeless. My volunteer work with them unleashed a longing inside me, a yearning to know if something more could be done. I returned to my roots, to my father's "farm", to learn more about growing food. I took a hydroponic farming class to learn more about indoor farming, and I am hoping to take an aquaponics class sometime in the fall. My explorations in the local agriculture scene led me to AgTech Week 2017, and led me to you.

  <p>So now you're probably still wondering, "Maureen, you haven't answered our questions yet! What does coding have to do with providing awesome customer service to our farmers?" Now I will tell you!  I have held various jobs throughout the years, in search of the something that would light my fire. I have always wanted to learn to code, so a couple of years ago, I decided to give myself a chance by learning to code through various online tutorials and books.  Was/is it difficult? Yes. Was/is it rewarding? Absolutely yes. But there were times, especially at the beginning, when I wished I had a human that I could bombard with questions. For example, questions like, "why am I so insufferably stupid?" It took me a while to soften my stance on myself. I wasn't stupid. I just didn't have practice, and practice is something that can only come with time.  The length of time one needs to learn something, however, can be shortened with an understanding, competent guide.</p>

  <p>And that's where I come in! I took a look at your software, and while it's meant to be written as intuitively as possible, it might not be so obvious for someone who has hasn't grown up with computers, or someone who isn't used to seeing farming as something driven by data. I would like to use my experiences in coding, teaching, and urban farming to be the best guide your customers need me to be. Using these experiences, I can guide customers through software that might seem daunting at first, but once they get more practice, will be as integral to their farms as organic compost or the correct grow lights.</p>

  <p>Thank you again for taking the time to read my story. I look forward to meeting with you in person to discuss how I can be an asset to your organization in the future.</p>
